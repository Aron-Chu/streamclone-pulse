description: Triage Pulse live coverage, missing prefix, and VOD backfill UX against backend state. Use when coverage cards, backfill steppers, "Load missed moments", or protect-channel flows misbehave or need design review.

# Coverage triage

## Read first

1. [`docs/pulse-extension/live-coverage-requirements.md`](../../docs/pulse-extension/live-coverage-requirements.md) — truth table, states, copy keys
2. Backend: streamclone `internal/analytics/pulse_coverage.go`, `extension_api.go`

## Triage checklist

- [ ] UI shows **coverage start → now**, not fabricated 00:00 data
- [ ] Path A (live tracking) and Path B (VOD backfill) are not conflated in copy or charts
- [ ] Backfill CTA only when backend approves (`waiting_for_vod`, eligible missing prefix)
- [ ] Progress/stepper reflects real job status from `GET /v1/extension/pulse/backfill/{jobId}`
- [ ] `full_stream_tracked` only when `coverageStartOffsetSeconds ≤ 120s` tolerance

## Quick probes

```bash
# streamclone checkout
curl -s "http://localhost:8090/v1/extension/pulse?login=<login>" | jq '{coverage, backfill, peaks: (.peaks|length)}'
```

## Report format

| Check | Expected | Actual | Fix area |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|

Flag **Critical** when UI implies data exists that backend did not produce.
